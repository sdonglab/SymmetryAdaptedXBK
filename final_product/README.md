This repository contains code to calculate the ground state energies of electronic Hamiltonians using a combination of the Xia-Ban-Kais transformation ([Xia, R., Bian, T., & Kais, S. (2017). Electronic Structure calculations and the Ising Hamiltonian. The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 122(13), 3384â€“3395. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10371](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10371)) and symmetry-adapted encodings based on the full Boolean symmetry group ([Picozzi, D., & Tennyson, J. (2023). Symmetry-adapted encodings for qubit number reduction by point-group and other Boolean symmetries. Quantum Science and Technology, 8(3), 035026. https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/acd86c](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acd86c)). 

We provide a novel implementation based on exact diagonalization to calculate the ground state properties using the XBK method using the functions we developed in utils.py. We provide a tutorial, tutorial.py, to guide new users to performing a sample calculation using our method and accompanying functions. 

The XBK_method.py, helper_funcs.py, and fieldmath.py files were copied from Copenhaver's [original implementation](https://github.com/jcopenh/Quantum-Chemistry-with-Annealers) of the XBK method in order to perform the mapping from a qubit Hamiltonian to an Ising Hamiltonian. The original implementation accompanies the author's paper ([Copenhaver, J., Wasserman, A., & Wehefritz-Kaufmann, B. (2021). Using quantum annealers to calculate ground state properties of molecules. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 154(3). https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0030397](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/154/3/034105/199868/Using-quantum-annealers-to-calculate-ground-state)).

We suggest that all work done with this repository is done within a virtual environment; for example, using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). We provide a .yml file containing the required packages (and versions) to run this repository.
