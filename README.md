# Symmetry-Adapted Xia-Bian-Kais Method for Electronic Structure Theory on Quantum Annealers

## Methods

This repository contains code to calculate the ground-state energies of electronic Hamiltonians using a combination of the Xia-Bian-Kais transformation ([Xia, R., Bian, T., & Kais, S. (2017). Electronic Structure calculations and the Ising Hamiltonian. The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 122(13), 3384â€“3395. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10371](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10371)) and symmetry-adapted encodings based on the full Boolean symmetry group ([Picozzi, D., & Tennyson, J. (2023). Symmetry-adapted encodings for qubit number reduction by point-group and other Boolean symmetries. Quantum Science and Technology, 8(3), 035026. https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/acd86c](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acd86c)). 

In `utils.py`, we provide a new implementation of the XBK method. This implementation is based on exact diagonalization. The `XBK_method.py`, `helper_funcs.py`, and `fieldmath.py` files were from Copenhaver's [repo](https://github.com/jcopenh/Quantum-Chemistry-with-Annealers) for the original implementation of the XBK method to perform the mapping from a qubit Hamiltonian to an Ising Hamiltonian. This original implementation accompanies the author's paper ([Copenhaver, J., Wasserman, A., & Wehefritz-Kaufmann, B. (2021). Using quantum annealers to calculate ground state properties of molecules. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 154(3). https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0030397](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/154/3/034105/199868/Using-quantum-annealers-to-calculate-ground-state)).

## Usage

We suggest using a virtual environment; for example, using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). We provide a .yml file containing the required packages and the versions tested to run the code.

We provide a tutorial in `tutorial.ipynb` to guide new users to performing an example calculation using our method and accompanying functions.
